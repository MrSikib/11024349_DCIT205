### WHAT I LEARNT 
Firstly, I learned the essentials of web programming which included HTML(tag and etc.)
and CSS(Styles).

This project also helped me gain knowledge on how to create some features such as image hovers, and adding backgrounds colors.

I also learnt the features and uses of Git commands such as 'git init' to initialize a repository, 'git commit' to save 
changes with a message, 'git add' to stage changes, and 'git push' to upload changes to a remote repository etc.
